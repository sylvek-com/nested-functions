# nested-functions
in Pascal and GNU C.
Computes factorial recursively with Python code
to verify accuracy of in fixed-decimal output.

The is a difference in output of the large integer represented using binary floating point.

Pascal outputs non-significant decimal digits as zeros, only approximating the binary integer stored in a "real".

C outputs non-significant decimal digits as non-zeros, exactly representing the binary integer stored in a "double".

Both integers are inaccurate when compared with actual integer value of the factorial.
